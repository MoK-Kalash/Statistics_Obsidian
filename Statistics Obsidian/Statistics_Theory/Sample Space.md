## Definition

A set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, defined so that exactly one of them must occur.

The sample space is most often visually repersented as a square with different Events represented as circular shapes within the Square. Where the square represents all of the possible outcomes. each shape represents a sub-set of the Sample Space and hence takes over a part of the square that is correspondent to the sub-set's size.

If two sub-sets share some outcomes in common then they overlap. Lastly the Sample Space is depicted mathematically with the letter **Î©** or more discretelly with the letter S.
