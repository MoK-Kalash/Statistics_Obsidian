# Equally Likely Outcomes

One of the multiple ways to define the probability of an event happening.


---
## Definition

In the case an experiments has outcomes which are all equally likely, then for any event A, we can define the probabily of A occuring *P*(A) as:
$$ 
	P(A) = \frac{
	Number\,\, of\,\, Equally\,\, Likely\,\, outcomes\,\, in\,\, A} 
	{Total\,\, number\,\, of\,\, Equally\,\, Likely\,\, outcomes\,\, in\,\, S}
$$
Where *P*(A) = The probability of A and is always a number between 0 and 1. 

Wheras if we are trying to find the likelyhood of anything occuring except for the specific event A; we have to find the [[Complement]] of A, A<sup>c</sup>. Where:
$$ 
	P(A^\complement) = \frac{
		( Total\,\, number\,\, of\,\,  outcomes\,\,) - (Number\,\, of\,\,  outcomes\,\, in\,\, A)} 
		{ Total\,\, number\,\, of\,\, Equally\,\, Likely\,\, outcomes\,\, in\,\, S} 
$$

## Example

Let's say we have a box containing an equal amount of marbles in 3 different colours Red (**R**), Green (**G**), Blue (**B**). What are the chances of a blindfolded person picking a Red marble? 

S = {R, G, B} 
E = {R}

$$
	P(E)= \frac{1}{3} 
$$

Given that the person chooses a marble randomly, the chances of picking a red one is 1/3.
