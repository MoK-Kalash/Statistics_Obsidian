# Expected Value

It is the most mathematically anticipated result of an experiment. 

---
## Definitions:

- ### With Random Variables with a Finite amount of outcomes

In the simplest of cases, as in when there are a finite amount of outcomes to a trial and the probability of each happening is known. The Expected Value is equal to the summ of the total numerical value of all outcomes multiplied respectively by their probability. Aka:

$$ E\,[X] = x_{1}p_{1}\,\,+\,\, x_{2}p_{2}\,\,+\,\, ...\,\,\ + x_{k}p_{k}$$
Where the Expected value is denoted as **E[X]**, each outcome is denoted of ** x<sub>n</sub>** and its' respective probability is denoted **p<sub>n</sub>** . 

Basically in the simplest of cases the Expected Value is the [[Weighted Average]].

## Example

Let *X* represent the outcome of a roll of a fair six-sided die. More specifically, *X* will be the number of pips showing on the top face of the die after the toss. The possible values for *X* are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all of which are equally likely with a probability of 1/6. The expectation of *X* is:  
$$ E[X] = 1*\frac{1}{6} +2*\frac{1}{6} +3*\frac{1}{6} +4*\frac{1}{6} +5*\frac{1}{6} +6*\frac{1}{6} = 3.5 $$
