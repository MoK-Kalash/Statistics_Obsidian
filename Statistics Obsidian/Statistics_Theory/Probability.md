# Probability

The likelyhood of an event to occour or that a proposition is true. In the case one is measuring the likelyhood of an event, it is measured by three approaches:
- [[Equally Likely Outcomes]],
- [[Relative Frequencies]],
- [[Subjective Probability]].

## Axioms of Probability

Consider any sample space **Ω** and any family of events **ε**. Let E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> be two only events within the Sample Space. Then *P* is a probability function if and only if it satisfies the following three axioms:

1. Non-Negativity  - Every event that has a possible outcome has to have a non negative value. 
		Aka *P* (E<sub>1</sub>) ≥ 0

2.  Addivity - If the intersection between E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> is 0, then the uninon between the two is equal to zero then the union between the two is equal to the summ of the probability of both happening.
			Aka if *P* (E<sub>1</sub> ∩ E<sub>2</sub>) = 0, then *P* (E<sub>1</sub> ∪ E<sub>2</sub>) = *P* (E<sub>1</sub>) + *P* (E<sub>2</sub>)

3. Normalisation - The probability of the Sample Space to happen has to equal to 1. Which means that the Sample Space has to contain all possible Events and outcomes thereof. 
		Aka *P* (Ω) = 1
